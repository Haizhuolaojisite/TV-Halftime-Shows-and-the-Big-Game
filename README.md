# TVHalftime-Shows-and-the-Big-Game
My Project in Python: Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy in the games themselves. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. In this project, you will find out how some of the elements interact with each other.  What are the most extreme game outcomes? How does point difference affect television viewership? How have viewership, TV ratings, and advertisement costs evolved? Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
